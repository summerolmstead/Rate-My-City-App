This is our Software Engineering Project! Our goal is to create a traveling social media similar to TripAdvisor, Yelp, etc.

Summer 10/1 : To have this run smoothly and less confusing for all, on your desktop folder -> name a folder on your desktop to "RateYourCity". Inside of this defined folder is where the html file and upload the chattpic4.jpg to the same folder. You can see the inital code created here. 

For example, my file path to my work is PS C:\Users\Summer\Desktop\RateYourCity\OriginalWebPage.html

To locally open this webpage just open your file explorer and click on the html file and it will automatically open on your browser to see the current webpage! :)

Use this command to clone repository -> 
->first just do to the path to add it so your users/desktop/rateyourcity folder open that in VS. open a new terminal then do this command:
cd path/to/desired/directory

ok now enter this command to get the inital code:
git clone https://github.com/summerolmstead/city-slickers.git

if ever want to add to this existing code - first make a fork then push the code to the fork so it doesnt affect the master branch. thx!!
