Software Engineering Semester Project. A web browser social media application where users can like, comment, and favorite objects in the category of the city they are interested in.
The demo has the cities Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Nashville. This originally had 108 Commits on it from all contributers. 
Originally this was being worked inside a private repo but had multiple vulnerabilities of leaks of API keys so I ended up going back and rewriting all the previous commits with leaks via command prompt with filtering/rewritting git packages.
This in turned deleted a good amount of the previous commits - however on 1.22.2025 I uploaded the whole final app back as when cleaning up the vulnerabilities this removed over 70
of the original commits by accident. Therefore, if you would like to view the code feel free to look through the different files! Keep in mind, there were originally more commits over time
by each member but this was deleted by accident from making this repo public to showcase our general work publically. Overall, we hope you enjoy looking at our final product code that is showcased in our file section!
This application is not being hosted on a server available to see up and running - this code was all conducted locally to our computers. Thank you!
