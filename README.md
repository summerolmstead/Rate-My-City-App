This is our Software Engineering Project! Our goal is to create a traveling social media similar to TripAdvisor, Yelp, etc.

Summer 10/1 : To have this run smoothly and less confusing for all, on your desktop folder -> name a folder on your desktop to "RateYourCity". Inside of this defined folder is where the html file and upload the chattpic4.jpg to the same folder. You can see the inital code created here. 

For example, my file path to my work is PS C:\Users\Summer\Desktop\RateYourCity\OriginalWebPage.html

To locally open this webpage just open your file explorer and click on the html file and it will automatically open on your browser to see the current webpage! :)
